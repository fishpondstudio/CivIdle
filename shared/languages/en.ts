      "Buildings are the basic building block of your empire - place them on the explored map tiles. Certain buildings like Stone Quarries and Aqueducts that extract deposits need to be placed on a deposit tile. A building will lift the fog of its surrounding tiles.<br><br>Buildings consume resources and produce new ones. They will <b>automatically</b> transport required resources. The produced resources will be stored in the buildings which can be transported into other buildings that need these resources. However, a building's storage space is limited.<br><br>Buildings need <b>workers</b> for transportation and production - you need to build residential buildings like <b>huts</b> to increase the worker population. You can upgrade a building to increase its production and storage.",
   Tutorial5:
      "<b>Science</b> is used to unlock technologies in the tech tree. A technology unlocks new buildings, wonders and boosts.<br><br><b>Busy workers</b> generate a small amount of science. Later on, you will unlock buildings like libraries and schools that produce science.<br><br>The amount of workers available is affected by <b>happiness</b>. Each building placed will cost 1 happiness. You gain happiness from technologies, wonders and great people. Make sure your workers are happy, otherwise your empire's production will halt.<br><br><b>Wonders</b> are a one of a kind building - you can only build one of each and they cannot be removed once built. There are also Natural Wonders that can be found by exploring the map. Wonders can provide significant boosts or unlock new mechanisms.",
   Tutorial6:
      "When you enter a new age, a new <b>great person</b> will be born. You can choose one out of three candidates.<br><br>Great people provide boosts and will be added to your permanent collection. When you rebirth, you collect all the great people you've chosen this run, plus extra great people based on your <b>total empire value</b>, these permanent great people will remain with you.<br><br><b>Permanent</b> great people can be upgraded by collecting great people from each run. They will help your empire achieve new heights.

   TutorialAdvices:
      "We have asked experienced players for their advice to first time players. Here are some very useful insights before you dive into the game.<ol><li><b>Don't upgrade all your buildings at the same time</b>: buildings being upgraded no longer produce</li><li><b>Pay attention to your happiness</b>: negative happiness reduces available workers and when happiness reaches -50, all production will halt</li><li><b>Don't over expand</b>: buildings require happiness to run. Make sure you have enough happiness before expanding</li><li><b>Prioritize houses, apartments and condos</b>: setting them to the highest priority can avoid fluctuating workers</li><li><b>You can rebirth any time in your home building</b>: it's okay to start over if you mess up your first map</li></ol>",
