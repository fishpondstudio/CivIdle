But keeping things producing is generally better.<br><br>One way to address full storage is via a warehouse. When you build a warehouse, you get a menu of every product you've discovered, and you can set the warehouse to pull any products in any amounts as long as the total for all products is within what the warehouse can pull based on its level and storage multiplier.<br><br>An easy way to set up a warehouse is to check off each product you want to import into the warehouse, and use the 'redistribute among selected' buttons to split your import rate and storage equally.
