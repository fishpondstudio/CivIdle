      "Power Plants provide two new systems to you. The first, 'Power' is indicated by the lightning bolt tiles adjacent to the power plant. Some buildings (starting with Radio in World Wars) have a 'requires power' indicator in their list of inputs. <b>This means they must be built on a lightning bolt tile to function</b>. Buildings that require power and have it, will also transmit power to the tiles adjacent to that building, so you can power them from each other as long as at least one is touching a power plant.<br><br>The other system 'electrification' can be applied to <b>any building anywhere</b> on the map as long as it doesn't produce science or workers. This uses up the power generated by the power plant to increase both the consumption and production of the building. More levels of electrification require larger and larger amounts of power. Electrifying buildings that also have 'requires power' is more efficient than electrifying the ones that don't.",

These will all bring you to the tech tree, showing you all the technologies, as well as how much science is required for each.

   AdvisorStorageContent:

This isn't always an issue, since you clearly have a large stockpile since the building is full. But keeping things producing is generally better.<br><br>One way to address full storage is via a warehouse. When you build a warehouse, you get a menu of every product you've discovered, and you can set the warehouse to pull any products in any amounts as long as the total for all products is within what the warehouse can pull based on its level and storage multiplier.<br><br>An easy way to set up a warehouse is to check off each product you want to import into the warehouse, and use the 'redistribute among selected' buttons to split your import rate and storage equally. If you want buildings to also be able to pull out of the warehouse, make sure to turn on the 'export below max amount' option as well.",
