The produced resources will be stored in the buildings which can be transported into other buildings that need these resources. However, a building's storage space is limited.<br><br>Buildings need <b>workers</b> for transportation and production - you need to build residential buildings like <b>huts</b> to increase the worker population. You can upgrade a building to increase its production and storage.",

And you gain happiness from technologies, wonders and great people. Make sure your workers are happy, otherwise your empire's production will halt.<br><br><b>Wonders</b> are one of a kind building - you can only build one and they cannot be removed once built. Wonders can provide significant boost or unlock new mechanisms.",
